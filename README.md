# Melting-Point-Prediction

This project aims to predict the melting point of a given organic molecule. I plan to try out both traditional machine learning approaches (PyCaret) and neural networks (Deep Chem).

## data

Folder containing Google Colab notebook I used to obtain & clean data from PubChem. Also, it contains .csv files of clean data.
