# Melting-Point-Prediction

This project aims to predict the melting point of a given organic molecule. I plan to try out both traditional machine learning approaches (PyCaret) and neural networks (Torch Drug).

## data

Folder containing Google Colab notebook I used to obtain & clean data from PubChem. Also, it contains .csv files of clean data. There are ~17000 molecules that have recorded melting points. Some of them are inorganic. Some have discrepancies in the recorded melting points. After cleaning, there are ~4000 organic molecules that can be used for training.
